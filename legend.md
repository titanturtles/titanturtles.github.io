We work hard, play hard. We appreciate everyone who spent their precious part of life to learn together, compete together, and have fun together here at Turtles. Because of that, we are connected forever. What ever you do. Where ever you go. We are always proud of our legendary alumni. Wish you have a unique wonderful life that you are proud of!

Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin Yu and I joined the club in my freshman year. I mainly worked on the Cisco Networking portion of the competition and did a bit of Boeing in my last year. Iâ€™ve had a lot of fun working with my friends and teammates over my 3 years on the team and would definitely do it again if I could. I will be attending the University of Washington as a student in the class of 2028 and will be majoring in computer science. I also plan to join a club swim team and continue swimming as itâ€™s something that Iâ€™ve been doing since I was 6! Some other hobbies of mine are playing basketball, a couple of video games, and just hanging out with my friends on drives. Overall, I feel like joining the TitanTurtles club and team was one of the best decisions Iâ€™ve made and it really feels like a family more than a team here. Highly recommend anyone to join ðŸ˜€!
