Hi everyone, my name is Anya Li, and Iâ€™ve competed in CyberPatriot for three years. I primarily worked on the Windows and Cisco subteams, and Iâ€™m really grateful for the opportunity to have been part of this team. It was awesome having the chance to learn cybersecurity through hands-on experience and collaborate with others who shared an interest in security. A lot of the skills I developed in competition have actually carried over into my everyday life as well.

Next year, Iâ€™m headed to Seattle to study computer science (and hopefully do security related research) at the University of Washington. Outside of the CS world, I love biking, politics, and anything nature related. Definitely consider participating in CyberPatriot, as itâ€™s truly a one of a kind competition experience where the skills you learn will continue to serve you long after the competitions are over!

I would strongly recommend the Westview TitanTurtles Cybersecurity Club to anyone interested in Computer Science.

Hello everyone! I am Arnold Yang, I started competing in CyberPatriot in freshman year and really loved it. Since then, I founded the Westview and Titanturtles Cybersecurity Clubs and have worked on all aspects of cybersecurity from CyberPatriot competition (primarily a linux main) to CTFs. I will attend Stanford University for CS and most likely mathematics. In my freetime I love to play chess, bridge and soccer, and read.

Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin Yu and I joined the club in my freshman year. I mainly worked on the Cisco Networking portion of the competition and did a bit of Boeing in my last year. Iâ€™ve had a lot of fun working with my friends and teammates over my 3 years on the team and would definitely do it again if I could. I will be attending the University of Washington as a student in the class of 2028 and will be majoring in computer science. I also plan to join a club swim team and continue swimming as itâ€™s something that Iâ€™ve been doing since I was 6! Some other hobbies of mine are playing basketball, a couple of video games, and just hanging out with my friends on drives. Overall, I feel like joining the TitanTurtles club and team was one of the best decisions Iâ€™ve made and it really feels like a family more than a team here. Highly recommend anyone to join ðŸ˜€!

Hey! Iâ€˜m Kishore, a high school senior currently studying at Westview HS and about to study at Oregon State University for college. Before I joined the club, I used to be a freelance programmer selling web apps/bots. Apart from CS, I also enjoy singing (solo and in a choir), lifting weights, studying philosophy and mindfulness.

I joined cybersecurity club in 11th grade right after I moved to the US, since Iâ€™ve always been interested in CS, programming and cybersecurity. I competed in various competitions like PicoCTF and CyberPatriot while in the club.

I greatly enjoyed taking part at club meetings and competitions, since it helped me learn new things related to coding and expand my horizons. Moreover, the club helped me build a community of like-minded coders which Iâ€˜m grateful for.
